I liked that Flash's father is the actor who played Flash back in the day. But some questions still don't convince. Barry as a boy had thick lips. How after years, the lips became thin? Did you have plastic surgery? In fact, speaking of kissy, Catlin is also kissy. And controlling, like all women.

UgziLMQqR7yBL9iHw_14AaABAg,hebWYacbdvc,The Flash – Official Trailer,Warner Bros.,"It's amazing how modern cinema manages to ruin comic book heroes. The original Flash story has nothing on this ridiculous version presented by Netflix. They invent and modify the character’s characteristics. Any day now, the colors of Superman's uniform will change. Who knows, maybe Superman will be Asian or black, or Indian. And the Hulk will be blue, red, pink or the colors of the rainbow. Tarzan will wear Nike. It is completely absurd to change the character's story, adding things that are not part of the original. I'm 68 years old and it disgusts me to see so much nonsense created by modern screenwriters and directors. Batman, Supernan, Hulk, Green Lantern and others have already changed. Now it was Flash's turn. Society is really going into decline. Maybe an asteroid to clean the planet of all this dirt?",@airgunsairsofts9490,2024-10-04T01:47:00Z,0,-0.7345895767211914,0.020102133974432945,0.2252061367034912,0.7546917200088501,0.18541032075881958,0.11195920407772064,0.012013028375804424,0.009289618581533432,0.01261643972247839,0.007971048355102539,0.6607402563095093

It says that if an action happens to you, then it will be resolved and it cannot be changed in any way Finally Anjaneyar will accept it and finally that is what they would have said in the movie Flash that fate cannot be changed
I just saw this movie in English, what it says is that destiny is fixed by itself and cannot be changed in any way, if you try to change it, it will take its destiny to another dimension.Apart from that, the Hindu god hanuman is shown in this film and as mentioned above, if an action has to happen, it has to happen and it cannot be changed in any way.

I really don't understand. I have watched this movie 12 times. It's a good movie but I don't know why it didn't run at the box office.

This style of bold, operatic composition brings an unmatched sense of grandeur. The full symphonic sound washes over you, instant goosebumps as that exhilarating melody unfurls. No words are needed to feel the mood - whether tensions simmering into war cries or heroes rising against the odds to turn the tide. The music amplifies the high stakes hinted onscreen into palpable excitement. These epic anthems punctuate trailers with exclamation points, ensuring the adventure ahead leaves an indelible impression whether it features clashing armies or character-driven drama. The marriage of epic music's unrelenting crescendo and carefully edited visuals forms a siren song, drawing us right into imagined new worlds brimming with action, emotion and spectacle. Who can resist such powerful musical storytelling, the ultimate appetizer promising grand purpose behind these tales? We have those ingenious sound composers to thank for trailers that spark such strong senses of destiny through their triumphant symphonic suites alone - our hearts quicken and imaginations ignite.",@BeautifulWarrior-sk7cu,2023-12-07T04:49:43Z,1,0.964260995388031,0.9692783951759338,0.025704247877001762,0.005017417017370462,0.0014801794895902276,0.00044673917000181973,0.0008434444316662848,0.9937934875488281,0.0012040783185511827,0.0010249038459733129,0.0012071315431967378
